<blockquote>Is a full stack JavaScript app for freecodecamp. This app let users to find venues where they live.</blockquote>
Here are the specific user stories that I implement for this project:

<ul>
  <li>User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.</li>
<li>User Story: As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.</li>
<li>User Story: As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.</li>
  <li>User Story: As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.</li>
</ul>
Also I use Yelp's API for these case of project.
